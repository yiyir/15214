hw5c Feedback
============

#### Working Project (7.5/10)
  * -2.5, Your submission does not run since you did not commit a dependency for `framework`.

#### Plugin Implementation (45/50)
  * Data Plugins:
  * 30/30, Your data plugins are appropriate for the framework and run without errors. Good job!

  * Visualization Plugins:
  * -5, Your `ScatterPlotPlugin` does not work since `XYChartBuilder` is an abstract class but you instantiated it.

#### Documentation and style (4/5)
  * -1, Avoid using magic numbers in your code. Declare variables as `static final` constants at the top of the file. ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/Team15/blob/master/hw5c/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw5/plugin/display/DailyValuePieChartPlugin.java))
