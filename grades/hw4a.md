============

#### Notation (20/20)

#### Domain Model (16/16)
  * 11/11, Your domain model appears reasonably complete. Well done.
  * 5/5, Your domain model matches our expectations regarding the level of abstraction.

#### System Sequence Diagram (7/8)
  * 4/5, Your system sequence diagram generally matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction. 
  * 3/3, Your system sequence diagram sufficiently models the interactions in the given scenario.

#### Behavioral Contracts (4/4)
  * 4/4, Your contracts reasonably describes the interface and are written at the right level of abstraction.

#### Interaction Diagram (`challenge`) (13/16)
  * 7/10, Your interaction diagram describes the challenge mechanism well, but misses some aspects of challenge mechanism, as annotated in the model.
  * 4/4, We have no major concerns regarding the design (e.g., responsibility assignment) of your validation interaction.
  * 2/2, Your interaction diagram matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction.

#### Interaction Diagram (`makeMove`) (9/16)
  * 4/10, Your interaction diagram roughly describes the move mechanism, but misses several major aspects of counting points or evaluating special tiles, as annotated in the model. 
  * 3/4, We have several questions or suggestions regarding the design of your move mechanisms, as annotated in the model. 
  * 2/2, Your interaction diagram matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction.

#### Object Model (16/16)
  * 4/4, We have no major concerns regarding the completeness of your object model.
  * 8/8, We have no major concerns regarding the design (e.g., responsibility assignment) in your object model.
  * 2/2, We have no major concerns regarding abstraction level and use of object-oriented concepts in your object model.
  * 2/2, Your object model matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction.

#### Justification (4/4)
  * 4/4, Your justification meets our expectations regarding vocabulary and discussion of design goals and principles.

#### Consistency (19/20)
  * -1, The `PlayMove()` has inconsistent signature as in your making a move interaction diagram and your object model.

You can regain up to 75% of the points lost in this milestone in Milestone C by addressing our comments and updating your design documents. If you have lost a large number of points, we recommend some interaction with the course staff. Beyond that, we do *not* pose additional questions that you need to answer for Milestone C.
