Code execution instructions:

To run the src code ('ParallelGitAnalysis', 'SequentialGitAnalysis'), please use the command line tool or edit run configurations in IDE. Edit the first argument of command line arguments or program arguments as the local git repository's path name plus "/.git" (e.g. "/Users/yiyiren/churn-rate-example/.git", "/Users/yiyiren/yiyir/.git", etc).

Something to note about tests:

The test cases included in the test package are for demonstration. They might fail due to different working environment(computers) or at different time(since the commit history might change).
